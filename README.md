## How do you get an application that is connected to a database that works locally, onto a server and to work remotely?

Long story short, I can get this application to work locally.  It is connected to a database locally as well.  When I move it to a server, database and all, and try to access it online, it all falls apart.  I've hit and overcome few obstacles and now I'm up against one I've not be able to get through for a good two weeks now.

I'm hitting a cors error but I've set this up to only use my node server per these instructions: https://flaviocopes.com/how-to-serve-react-from-same-origin/

You can access the project at http://45.79.173.103:5000/.  The funny thing is you can hit the database at http://45.79.173.103:5000/todos, and when you hit the back button, if you were just on http://45.79.173.103:5000/, an entry from the database will pop up.  Although is is messy.  So how does hitting the back button get it to sort of work?  Haha.

Anyways, I am ready to start from scratch and not use a tutorial but I think that would take me at least another month, if not two, as I am new to React and this is my first time developing something serious.  I mean to make this more than a basic todo app but I would like to get some foundational stuff down first.
